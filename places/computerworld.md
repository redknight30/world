Computer World
====

Computer World is a kingdom ruled by his Holy Emperor Chris and his minions. The castle is large and majestic. There are rolling hills and green grass. Everything is run by computers that are easy to use. Everyone is happy here except when there are wars with surrounding kingdoms.

The castle is a medieval style with large spires and flying buttresses and also the occasional trap.

To the south, there is another kingdom called [Robotic Empire]( roboticempire.md ) where Emperor Lance is the ruler. Chris has a deflector shield but anybody can go in it.
